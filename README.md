# COVID-19 Time Series Forecasting using ARIMA

## Overview
This project analyzes the temporal progression of COVID-19 cases and applies classical
time-series forecasting techniques to model short-term trends.

The analysis was conducted in a Jupyter Notebook using publicly available datasets from Kaggle.

## Objective
To explore COVID-19 case trajectories over time and assess the applicability of ARIMA models
for time-series forecasting.

## Dataset
- COVID-19 case data sourced from **Kaggle**
- Time-indexed confirmed case counts across countries and regions
- Dataset used in accordance with Kaggle dataset and competition guidelines

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to study global and country-level trends
- Visualization of temporal patterns in confirmed cases
- Stationarity checks and time-series preparation
- ARIMA model fitting and short-horizon forecasting
- Interpretation of forecasts and modeling limitations

## Project Structure
The repository consists of a single Jupyter Notebook containing:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory visual analysis
- ARIMA model implementation
- Forecast generation and discussion

## Results
The ARIMA model captures general temporal patterns in COVID-19 case counts.
The results highlight both the usefulness and limitations of classical time-series models
when applied to rapidly evolving real-world data.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- statsmodels (ARIMA)

## Notes
- This project is intended for exploratory and educational purposes
- Forecasts are illustrative and should not be interpreted as medical or policy guidance
